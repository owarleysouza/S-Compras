# About this Project
The idea of the App is help you to make your shopping list previously, providing a simple and good way to buy groceries.

# Why?
This project is so important to me because it's the first app that I have created it myself. And it's a solution that was motivated for a problem that my parents had to buy groceries.

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer.
